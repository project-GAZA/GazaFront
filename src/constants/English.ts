      This project started with the idea of "I want to make a small contribution to the pain and suffering of the children of Gaza."
      <br />
      <br />
      While planning the project, we put a lot of thought and effort into focusing on the children of Gaza without any religious or political bias. Our ancestors built Korea with the help of the entire world, even in the midst of war, and now we want to be a part of that help and bring hope to the children of Gaza.
      <br />
      <br />
      We want to help them grow up to be the shapers of a better world, not the shadows of terror. This is not just a helping hand, but a firm step towards a future of peace and prosperity. We are starting a project to make a small but tangible difference to the children of Gaza, so that they can have a bright future and grow up to be great members of the next generation.

      <strong>Regarding donations</strong>
  <br/><br/>
  ● All donations, except for server costs, will be used to produce the booklet, with any remaining funds going to Gaza relief efforts. <br/>
  ● The fundraising status is transparently disclosed in the TOS ID (PEACEGAZA) history, and the accumulated donations are updated on this website every hour.<br/>
   ● We are also looking for designated donor organizations for payment PG integration and donation tax deduction cooperation. Please contact us at peace.in.gaza.kr@gmail.com.<br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>About the booklet</strong>
      <br/><br/>
      ● All messages in the booklet will be filtered for inappropriate words (profanity, sexual slurs, etc.) and translated into Arabic.<br/>
      ● As for the brochure design prototype, we'll keep you updated as we make progress.<br/>
